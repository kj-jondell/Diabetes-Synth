# WHAT IS THIS?
A wavetable-synthesizer using blood glucose levels as periodic waveforms. Controllable using MIDI.

## Python
The Python code converts data taken from the Abbott FreeStyle Libre and converts into 2048-sample long periodic waveforms (in the form of wav-files). The data uses spline interpolation and windowing. It also outputs the order of spectral centroids of the waveforms from low to high.
